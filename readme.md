# WebGL Game Engine
## A small, less than optimized game engine built for University of the Pacific's Computer Graphics class.

### Features (Very rushed): 
* 3D FPS Rendering system built on top of WebGL
* Compositable Node-based scene trees with inherited transforms
* 3D Positional audio nodes built on top of Howler.js
* A basic shader abstraction system to allow easier creation of custom shaders
* And more I have forgotten about...

### Running
To run this project, make sure Node.js is installed.
Afterward, run the ```npm install``` command to install the necessary dependencies.
Then run the ```npm run dev``` command to start the local server.
